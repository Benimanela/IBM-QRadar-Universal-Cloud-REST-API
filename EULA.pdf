(   "IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its)'
(   subsidiaries.)'
()'
(   "License Information" \("LI"\) - a document that provides information and)'
(   any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available)'
(   at www.ibm.com/software/sla. The LI can also be found in the Program's)'
(   directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with)'
(   the Program.)'
()'
(   "Program" - the following, including the original and all whole or partial)'
(   copies: 1\) machine-readable instructions and data, 2\) components, files,)'
