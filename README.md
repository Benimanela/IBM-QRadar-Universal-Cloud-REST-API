# IBM-QRadar-Universal-Cloud-REST-API

The main goal of the Universal Cloud REST API Protocol is to enable ingestion of currently unsupported data source 
 - Predefined workflow to easily guide users through the configuration process
 - Users can collect data from multiple cloud data platforms
 - Improved operational efficiency by providing tools to easily on-board data sources, i.e. Log Source Management App, DSM Editor
 - As Vendors make changes to their APIs, we can easily adapt to those changes by editing the existing workflow
